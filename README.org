A work-in-progress bytecode interpreter based on /[[https://craftinginterpreters.com/][Crafting Interpreters]]/. My primary goal with this project is to learn and understand how a scanner, compiler and virtual machine work in unison to run a piece of code. So performance and efficiency will take a backseat for now.

I'm fairly new to programming in Rust so I +copy from+ refer to these projects whenever I struggle with translating a piece of C code to Rust.
