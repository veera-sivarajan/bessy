A work-in-progress bytecode interpreter based on /[[https://craftinginterpreters.com/][Crafting Interpreters]]/. My primary goal with this project is to learn and understand how a scanner, compiler and virtual machine work to run a piece of code. So performance and efficiency will take a backseat for now.
** Playground
Thanks to ~wasm~, you can use the compiler through a [[https://veera.app/bessy/][web text editor]].

Compiling it to ~wasm~ was done by following this [[https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/hello-world.html][tutorial]]. User interface is written in vanilla javascript using [[https://codemirror.net/][CodeMirror]] for text editor and [[https://xtermjs.org/][Xterm.js]] for displaying the output.

This web interface was inspired by:
1. [[https://skiff.paulbiberstein.me/][skiff]]
2. [[https://cstea.peppe.rs/][cstea]]
** References
I'm fairly new to programming in Rust so I refer to these projects whenever I struggle with translating a piece of C code to Rust.
